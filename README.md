# Office365_MFA
PowerShell Scripts to Manage MFA

Had to wipe out MFA settings on User accounts more than once this week, so I went ahead and wrote some automation to make it easier for the next time!

Script Set_O365_MFA_Options.ps1 was meant to automatically set the preferred method, but doesn't seem to be working properly since the user cannot set options when logging in. Eventually would like to research how to make this work.
